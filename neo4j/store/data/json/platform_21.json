The 8-bit video game console was released by Nintendo in North America, Europe, and Australia in 1985 (although it was released in 1983 in Japan). In Japan and many other Asian countries, the NES was known as the Family Computer (or as it came to be later known: the Famicom). In some Asian countries, it was known as the Tata Famicom.</p><p>After the video game market crash of 1983, the NES was the perfect revitalization. because of this, it was the best-selling video game console of all time. The NES introduced many conventions that have become standard including game controller layout and third-party software licensing.</p><h2>History</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1702011\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-screen\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/9/91168/1702011-nes_control_deck_boxed_super.jpg\" title=\"A boxed NES Control Deck.\"><img id=\"1702011\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/9/91168/1702011-nes_control_deck_boxed_screen.jpg\" alt=\"A boxed NES Control Deck.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">A boxed NES Control Deck.</div></div></div></div><p>After the success of the arcade game in the 1980s, Nintendo looked to <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/masayuki-uemura/72-69066/\">Masayuki Uemura</a> to design a cartridge-based home console. It was first released in Japan on July 15, 1983. Three launch titles were available: <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/donkey-kong/61-311/\">Donkey Kong</a>, <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/donkey-kong-jr/61-19416/\">Donkey Kong Jr.</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/popeye/61-14419/\">Popeye</a>. At first, the console was prone to crashes (due to a bad chip set). After a re-release with a new motherboard, the Famicom became incredibly popular.</p><p>In an effort to enter the North American market, Nintendo negotiated with Atari to release the Famicom as the Nintendo Advanced Video Gaming System, but the deal didn't get off the ground. In June of 1985, Nintendo unveiled the North American version of the Famicom; the NES. On October 18, 1985, the NES was released, along with eighteen launch titles. Two boxed sets were released, the Deluxe Set (console, <a href=\"/rob/94-1707/\">R.O.B</a>., <a href=\"/light-gun/92-2354/\">Zapper</a>, two controllers, <a href=\"/duck-hunt/61-2758/\">Duck Hunt</a>, and <a href=\"/gyromite/61-20055/\">Gyromite</a>) and the Control Deck (console, two controllers and <a href=\"/super-mario-bros/61-15544/\">Super Mario Bros.</a>).</p><h3>Tough Times</h3><p>Nintendo had a hard time getting the NES sold, because most consumers thought video games were over with. They realized this and started marketing the NES as a toy instead of a video game. They packed in a light gun and a robot with the console and people started to pay attention. In December of 1985 Nintendo went to toy stores around New York City to try and sell the NES and said if the consoles don't sell they will buy them back. This gave Nintendo a foothold but they still needed to get the NES into the hands of more people.</p><p>They contacted Worlds of Wonder, a toy company who made the two most popular toys in 1985, Lazer Tag and Teddy Ruxpin, and said if they can get Nintendo into the big department stores their toys are in they can have a percentage of Nintendo's sales. Worlds of Wonder agreed to this deal, so whenever a store called and wanted to order a toy, they would require that store to order 500 NES consoles. This is how Nintendo first got into the American market.</p><h3>Licensing</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"816796\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/7464/816796-nintendo_seal_of_quality_super.jpg\" title=\"Nintendo's seal of quality\"><img id=\"816796\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/7464/816796-nintendo_seal_of_quality_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo's seal of quality\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Nintendo's seal of quality</div></div></div></div><p>Nintendo's licensing techniques were both revolutionary and for a time, illegal. Nintendo had a veritable monopoly on the market at the time, so they encouraged developers to make games for their console. But, developers had to sign a contract stating they would only develop games for the NES. Also, a chip was instituted into the NES called the 10NES. If this same chip was not found in the cartridge, the game wouldn't load. Eventually, however, these business practices were ultimately outlawed.</p><p>Despite Nintendo's efforts, unlicensed games were still created for the system. Designers found ways to bypass the 10NES chip. One such way was to short circuit the chip, temporarily ceasing its function. However, <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/atari-games-corporation/65-794/\">Atari Games</a> created unlicensed software for the NES under the name <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/tengen/65-752/\">Tengen</a>. Tengen didn't want to be held liable for short-circuiting and possibly damaging the NES, so they devised a chip (nicknamed Rabbit) that disabled the 10NES chip. It was later discovered that their patent was acquired illegally, and thus, they were sued by Nintendo and lost.</p><h2>Launch Games</h2><p><b>Japan - July 15, 1983</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/donkey-kong/61-311/\">Donkey Kong</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/donkey-kong-jr/61-19416/\">Donkey Kong Jr.</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/popeye/61-14419/\">Popeye</a></li></ul><h3>North America - October 18, 1985</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/10-yard-fight/61-10166/\">10 Yard Fight</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/balloon-fight/61-86/\">Balloon Fight</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/baseball/61-8145/\">Baseball</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/clu-clu-land/61-4721/\">Clu Clu Land</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/donkey-kong-jr-math/61-18503/\">Donkey Kong Jr. Math</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/duck-hunt/61-2758/\">Duck Hunt</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/excitebike/61-15025/\">Excitebike</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/golf/61-22096/\">Golf</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/gyromite/61-20055/\">Gyromite</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/hogans-alley/61-6490/\">Hogan's Alley</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/ice-climber/61-13918/\">Ice Climber</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/kung-fu-master/61-5996/\">Kung Fu</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/mach-rider/61-5930/\">Mach Rider</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/pinball/61-20885/\">Pinball</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/stack-up/61-19746/\">Stack-Up</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/super-mario-bros/61-15544/\">Super Mario Bros.</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/tennis/61-20780/\">Tennis</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/wild-gunman/61-4116/\">Wild Gunman</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/wrecking-crew/61-14710/\">Wrecking Crew</a></li></ul><p><b>Europe - September 1, 1986</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/10-yard-fight/61-10166/\">10-Yard Fight</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/baseball/61-8145/\">Baseball</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/clu-clu-land/61-4721/\">Clu Clu Land</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/donkey-kong-jr-math/61-18503/\">Donkey Kong Jr Math</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/duck-hunt/61-2758/\">Duck Hunt</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/excitebike/61-15025/\">Excitebike</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/golf/61-22096/\">Golf</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/gyromite/61-20055/\">Gyromite</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/hogans-alley/61-6490/\">Hogan's Alley</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/ice-climber/61-13918/\">Ice Climber</a></li><li><a href=\"/kung-fu-master/61-5996/\">Kung Fu</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/mach-rider/61-5930/\">Mach Rider</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/pinball/61-20885/\">Pinball</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/stack-up/61-19746/\">Stack-up</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/super-mario-bros/61-15544/\">Super Mario Bros.</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/tennis/61-20780/\">Tennis</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/wild-gunman/61-4116/\">Wild Gunman</a></li><li><a href=\"/wrecking-crew/61-14710/\">Wrecking Crew</a></li></ul><h2>Technical Specifications</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1705460\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1705460-816804_10nes_super_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1705460\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1705460-816804_10nes_super_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><ul><li><b>CPU</b>: 8-bit microprocessor (by Ricoh, based on MOS Technology 6502 core) operating at 1.79MHz on NTSC systems and 1.66MHz on PAL systems.</li><li><b>Memory</b>: 2kB of random access memory, 49,128 bytes of read-only memory</li><li><b>Video</b>: Custom-made picture processing unit (by Ricoh) named RP2C02 (in NTSC models, operates at 5.37 MHz) and RP2C07 (in PAL models, operates at 5.32 MHz)</li><li>Color palette of 48 colors and 5 grays, 25 colors on one scanline</li><li>64 sprites displayed on the screen simultaneously (sprites can be either 8 x 8 pixels or 8 x 16 pixels)</li><li>Display resolution is 256 x 240 pixels (effective resolution of 256 x 224 pixels)</li><li><b>Audio</b>: Ricoh RP2A03 on NTSC systems and Ricoh RP2A07 on PAL systems.

Known as the top-loader, this version is nearly identical to the original model, but it has several key differences. The main difference, and the reason for its nickname, is the fact that cartridges are loaded into a slot on the top of the console, rather than through a tray at the front. It also sported a different color scheme and controllers, a redesigned logo, and modified circuit boards to improve the video output. NES-101 was known as HVC-101 in Japan, and was released on December 1, 1993.</p><h2>Accessories</h2><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><th><h3>Nintendo Zapper</h3></th></tr><tr><td>The Zapper was a light gun that came bundled with the NES later on in its life span.

The Dendy differs slightly from the NES in terms of hardware, containing a slightly different chipset. There were several variations of the Dendy, such as Dendy Classic and Dendy Junior. Cartridges were typically bootleg versions of official games, or even compilations, and were similar in appearance to the Famicom cartridges.</p>","deck":"The NES was launched when the video game industry was headed downhill due to a deluge of poor games and over-saturation.
