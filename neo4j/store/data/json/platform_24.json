The line was later expanded to include the more-powerful Atari XL models and then the XE models. Atari's second cartridge-based console, the <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/atari-5200/60-67/\">Atari 5200</a>, is also based on the same hardware, resulting in many games appearing to be identical across all platforms. The Atari 5200 was followed by the Atari XE Game System which is also based on the Atari 8-bit computers.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><p>All models uses the MOS Technology 6502 CPU which is the same type of CPU used in the <a href=\"/atari-2600/60-40/\">Atari 2600</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/nes/60-21/\">NES</a>. The computers also includes custom chips like the ANTIC display instruction processor, the CTIA/GTIA GPU and the POKEY audio chip. The Atari 400 and 800 were supposed to have 4kB and 8kB RAM respectively, and the names 400 and 800 were originally decided upon because of this, but both models were released with 8kB of RAM since the price of memory had fallen when they were released. The 400 has a membrane keyboard while the 800 has a regular one. The 800 also has two ROM cartridge slots instead of the single slot in the 400. Despite this, the 400 outsold the 800 somewhat.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"297922\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/4910/297922-atari_800xl_plain_white_super.jpg\" title=\"Atari 800XL\"><img id=\"297922\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/4910/297922-atari_800xl_plain_white_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Atari 800XL\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Atari 800XL</div></div></div></div><p>In 1982 the 1200XL was released which came with 64kB RAM, a redesigned aluminum case and more custom keys. Some older software was incompatible with the new OS however. A year later the 600XL and 800XL were released which replaced the other models, including the 1200XL. The 600XL had 16kB of RAM and the 800XL had 64kB like the 1200XL did, and used the same general design. A new hardware feature on both these models was the expansion port called the Parallel Bus Interface.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1303271\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/9559/1303271-atari_130xe_super.jpg\" title=\"Atari 130XE\"><img id=\"1303271\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/9559/1303271-atari_130xe_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Atari 130XE\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Atari 130XE</div></div></div></div><p>After Atari was acquired by Jack Tremiel in 1985, the 8-bit Atari computers once again got a new hardware revision known as the XE series along with the 16-bit <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/atari-st/60-13/\">Atari ST</a> computer. XE stands for XL-Enhanced. They have a similar case design to the Atari ST line of computers but are otherwise identical on the hardware level to the old 8-bit computers, except for the newer Enhanced Cartridge Interface instead of the Paralell Bus Interface and the fact that the 130XE had 128kB of RAM.</p><p>In 1987, after seeing the success of the <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/nes/60-21/\">NES</a>, Atari wanted back in on the console market.

It included a detachable keyboard, a joystick, a <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/light-gun/92-2354/\">lightgun</a> and the games Bug Hunt and <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/flight-simulator-ii/61-14112/\">Flight Simulator II</a>. Instead of cassette tapes or diskettes, the XE Game System uses cartridges like most other home consoles at the time. Because the XE Game System was almost the same hardware-wise as the 65XE, a lot of software and hardware for the Atari 8-bit computers are compatible. The system didn't sell as well as hoped, partly because of bad marketing and the fact that new releases for the system were few and far between.</p><p>In 1992, Atari officially dropped support for their entire 8-bit line of machines.</p><h3>Models</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1303277\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/9559/1303277-atari_400_keyboard_super.jpg\" title=\"Atari 400's membrane keyboard\"><img id=\"1303277\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/9559/1303277-atari_400_keyboard_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Atari 400's membrane keyboard\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Atari 400's membrane keyboard</div></div></div></div><ul><li>400 and 800 (1979) – original machines in beige cases, 400 has a membrane keyboard, 800 has \"full-travel\" keys, two cartridge ports, monitor output, expandable memory slots (up to 48 KB).

The most common add-on is probably the different cassette tape drives since many games were released on cassette tapes. The peripherals use the SIO port and can be chained together to have more than one peripheral plugged in at once.</p>","deck":"A line of 8-bit computers produced by Atari, Inc. from 1979 to 1992.","company":{"api_detail_url":"http://api.giantbomb.com/company/182/","id":182,"name":"Atari"},"install_base":0,"site_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/atari-8-bit/60-24/","id":24,"api_detail_url":"http://api.giantbomb.com/platform/24/","abbreviation":"A800","online_support":true,"date_added":"2008-04-01 01:32:52","image":{"icon_url":"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/26/10170-Atari-800_icon.jpg","medium_url":"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/26/10170-Atari-800_small.jpg","tiny_url":"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/26/10170-Atari-800_tiny.jpg","small_url":"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/26/10170-Atari-800_small.jpg","thumb_url":"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/26/10170-Atari-800_thumb.jpg","screen_url":"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/26/10170-Atari-800_screen.jpg","super_url":"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/26/10170-Atari-800_super.jpg"},"release_date":"1979-11-01 00:00:00","name":"Atari 8-bit"}
