Inspired by the success of VHS as a standard for video cassette recorders he had proposed the MSX standard as a single industry standard for home computers. Trying to create something the <a href=\"/pc/60-94/\">                     PC</a> later became.<br /><br />The MSX standard was first formally announced in 1983 and was followed by three other standards: MSX2 (1986), MSX2  (1988) and MSX turbo R (1990).<br /><br />Over a hundred different companies have manufactured MSX computers. The list of companies includes: <a href=\"/sony-computer-entertainment-america/65-313/\">                    Sony</a>, <a href=\"/panasonic-interactive-media/65-1546/\">                   Panasonic</a>, Sanyo, JVC, Spectravideo, <a href=\"/toshiba-corporation/65-2638/\">                  Toshiba</a>, Canon, <a href=\"/casio-co-ltd/65-2008/\">                 Casio</a>, Dragon, Dyndata, <a href=\"/fujitsu/65-6596/\">                Fujitsu</a>, Hitachi, Sharp/Epcom, <a href=\"/pioneer-productions/65-845/\">               Pioneer</a>, Alalamia, Mitsubishi, NEC, <a href=\"/philips-interactive-media-inc/65-48/\">              Philips</a>, Radiola, Schneider, Talent, Telematica, Yamaha, Yashica, Aster International, General, Samsung, Hyosung, Limco, Oric, Radofin.<br /><br />Although being a Microsoft-led initiative, the MSX-based machines were seldom seen in the <a href=\"/the-united-states-of-america/95-396/\">             United States</a>. Most of the Japanese companies decided to avoid the intensely competitive U.S. market, only Spectravideo and Yamaha decided otherwise. The MSX computers became popular in <a href=\"/japan/95-37/\">           Japan</a>, <a href=\"/south-korea/95-2410/\">            South Korea</a>, <a href=\"/brazil/95-720/\">          Brazil</a>, <a href=\"/the-netherlands/95-1279/\">         Netherlands</a>, <a href=\"/france/95-197/\">        France</a>, <a href=\"/spain/95-527/\">       Spain</a>, <a href=\"/finland/95-1568/\">      Finland</a>, Kuwait&nbsp;and former <a href=\"/soviet-union/95-507/\">     Soviet Union</a>.
