The game was released on Windows PCs only, and is a straightforward affair. Players are challenged to beat enemies, and the game is condensed down to one resource: money. You may spend money on new units, and should enemies destroy the unit, you are refunded the value of that unit. The game includes a simplistic chat interface which is available between missions, which allows players to purchase new units and unit upgrades. The game was originally released in <a href=\"/poland/95-1722/\"> Poland</a> under the name of 'Reflux'.
