With an MSRP of $399.99 USD the console was released in conjunction with Modern Warfare 2 on November 10th, 2009. This Limited Edition was packaged with a 250 GB hard drive, a copy of Modern Warfare 2, two black wireless controllers, a black headset, and a modified case design. Microsoft worked exclusively with Infinity Ward's art designers to produce a unique black and gray military styled case that matches Modern Warfare 2.</p><h3>Xbox 360 Premium</h3><p>The Xbox 360 Premium was identical to the Xbox 360 Pro configuration but contained an older CPU architecture. Manufacturing for the Premium branded units ceased in August 2007.</p><h3>Xbox 360 Core</h3><p>The Xbox 360 Core was the barebones 360 model that carried an MSRP of $279.99 and was similar to the current Arcade configuration. It included a wired controller, had no HDMI port, and did not include any kind of storage. The Xbox 360 Core was often seen as a misstep because its production meant that developers could not take advantage of the features Xbox 360 HDD in their games, since not all users would have one. It's main benefit to Microsoft was in marketing the platform when it was launched, as they were able to state that consumers could buy an Xbox 360 for \"under $300,\" even though the more desirable Xbox 360 Premium was close to $400 USD at the time.</p><h3>Xbox 360 Pro</h3><p>The Xbox 360 Pro, available in the \"Go Pro\" bundle, had an MSRP of $249.99 USD and replaced the Xbox 360 Premium SKU. Included in the bundle were all the features found in the Xbox 360 Arcade, as well as a 60 GB hard drive and a hybrid composite/component cable. The pre-loaded, detachable 60GB hard drive came with game demos, video clips and a free Live Arcade game: Hexic HD. The hard drive allowed for the storage of downloaded content, backwards compatibility with original Xbox games, and storage of game saves. The Xbox 360 Pro bundle carried an MSRP of $299.99 USD. Prior to August 2008, the included HDD was only 20GB. For the 2007 holiday shopping season, Microsoft bundled copies of <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/forza-motorsport-2/61-5881/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forza Motorsport 2</a> and <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/marvel-ultimate-alliance/61-7527/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marvel: Ultimate Alliance</a> with the Xbox 360 Pro.

This disc also includes a \"Welcome Video\" and several game trailers/demos. Officially announce on October 22, 2007, the Xbox 360 Arcade has a MSRP of $199.99 USD. Recently Microsoft confirmed that they are now putting internal memory into the Xbox 360 Arcade. This storage will be the same size as the previous external memory units: 256MB. Xbox 360 Arcade systems packaged for the 2008 holiday shopping season are bundled with a copy of <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/sega-superstars-tennis/61-20578/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sega Superstars Tennis</a>.</p><h3>Xbox 360 Elite</h3><p>The Elite is currently the mid-end Xbox 360 configuration carrying an MSRP of $249.99 USD.

In 2010, Microsoft introduced a redesigned Xbox 360 and reduced the price of the 360 Elite to $249.99.</p><h3>Xbox 360 Splinter Cell Conviction Bundle</h3><p>Released with little to no fanfare, the <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/61-20464/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Splinter Cell Conviction</a> bundle is quite similar to its immediate predecessor, the Final Fantasy XIII bundle. It includes a black Xbox 360 Console, a 250GB HDD, two black Xbox 360 controllers, and a copy of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Conviction. Unlike many of the special edition Xbox 360 bundles, this one does not feature any unique artwork or designs on any of the included hardware.

Activision's <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/call-of-duty-2/61-2347/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Call of Duty 2</a> introduces console gamers to the series and became the biggest game on Xbox Live during launch. Later in 2006, Epic Games released <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/gears-of-war-2/61-20662/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gears of War</a>, what was considered to be the \"killer app\" of the Xbox 360. Thanks to the game's impressive graphics and multiplayer, the game became a big hit. 2007 would follow many games like <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/halo-3/61-9993/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Halo 3</a> (one of the most hyped games of the year), <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/mass-effect/61-16909/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mass Effect</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/61-2133/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</a>, which broke many records on Xbox Live when it was released, with its <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/modern-warfare-2/61-24713/\" rel=\"nofollow\">sequel</a> surpassing it. Many other sequels would be released including <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/fable-ii/61-20514/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fable 2</a> and <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/banjo-kazooie-nuts-bolts/61-20586/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Banjo Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts</a> within the later years.</p><p>One key feature to Xbox Live's success is the Xbox Live Arcade games.

Other launch titles include Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved and Marble Blast Ultra. In the beginning, Microsoft restricted Arcade game sizes to no more than 50 MB big due to the Core model and its memory card. Later, when the 256 MB memory card was released, the game size limit was expanded. Today you're able to get full games online and games can be installed to your hard drive.</p><h2>New Xbox Experience (NXE)</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"365903\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/1694/365903-360_dashboard_super.jpg\" title=\"The old Xbox 360 Dashboard\"><img id=\"365903\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/1694/365903-360_dashboard_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The old Xbox 360 Dashboard\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The old Xbox 360 Dashboard</div></div></div></div><p>Since launch the main way of interacting with the Xbox 360 has been using the 'Dashboard', a menu system split into sections by 'Blades'; initially the 'Dashboard' consisted of four 'Blades:' Live, Games, Media and Settings; a blade was later added which separated the Xbox Live Marketplace from the Xbox Live 'Blade'. At the 2008 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) Microsoft announced it would be completely redesigning the Xbox Dashboard into a more conventional menu system dubbed the <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/new-xbox-experience/92-2426/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Xbox Experience</a>.</p><p>The New Xbox Experience (NXE) is designed to be more user friendly and to be expandable as new content is added, it takes several design cues from the likes of Apple and Nintendo, and introduces several new features such as Avatars and Live Party.

The disc of the game played from the HDD is still required to be in the DVD drive.</li><li>Deleting Zero-Point games: The ability to delete games with no achievements unlocked has become possible, so that players may improve their ratio of possible achievements to ones gained.</li><li>Netflix: The Xbox 360 gained the ability to stream movies from Netfilx to view on your TV. This feature is only available to gold members and requires a Netflix paid account.</li></ul><p>The new Xbox 360 Guide (accessible through the Xbox button on the controller) will mimic the interface of the \"Blade\" dashboard system. It's accessible in all Xbox 360 games to manage messages/invites, create parties, view player statistics, et cetera.</p><p>The NXE update was distributed in the fall of 2008, and took 128 Mb of space to install. Those not meeting this requirement (The Arcade and Core SKUs not having hard drives) were given a free memory unit (512MB) by Microsoft or the option to buy a 20GB Hard Drive at $20.</p><h3>Features after NXE:</h3><p>At CES 2009 Microsoft's Robby Bach announced <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-live-primetime/92-2647/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xbox Live Primetime</a>.

Other features include Last.fm, Zune HD, and accessing news stations like MSNBC.</p><h2>Criticisms</h2><p>There are a number of criticism that are often leveraged against the Xbox 360, the main one being unreliable hardware quality; however, excessive DVD drive noise and a confusing amount of hardware configurations are also targeted by critics of the system.</p><h3>'The Red Ring of Death'</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"326567\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/1694/326567-red_ring_of_death_1__super.jpg\" title=\"Red Ring of Death\"><img id=\"326567\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/1694/326567-red_ring_of_death_1__thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Red Ring of Death\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Red Ring of Death</div></div></div></div><p>The Xbox 360 has gained a reputation for a high failure rate, sometimes rumored to be as high as 30% although Microsoft have denied the failure rate is that high; they have not released an official failure rate. The most common hardware failure is the General Hardware Failure, denoted by the bottom two and upper right quadrant of the Ring of Light flashing red; leading to the failure being dubbed the ' <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/red-ring-of-death/92-290/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red Ring of Death</a>'. This failure renders the console unable to boot or 'bricked' and the only official course of action for the consumer being to call Xbox support to ship the console back to Microsoft where it is either repaired or replaced. While there is no official course of action on fixing the Red Ring of Death there are some unofficial solutions to try. The most popular is called the \"towel trick\" in which you take everything off of your Xbox 360, your hard-drive, A/V cables, etc. The only thing you want plugged in is the power supply. Now you wrap it in three (3) large towels (the ones you would use to dry yourself off after a shower) and turn it on. Let it sit running for 20-30 minutes, turn it off, and let it cool off for another 15. Then turn it on and it should work. *Note this is not a permanent solution.*</p><p>No official reason has been given by Microsoft as to why this error is so common place, however most speculation points towards insufficient cooling around the GPU leading to a warping of the motherboard. Microsoft has taken steps to solve this problem by adding an additional heat sink to the GPU in later units and units returned from repair. These changes were included in a chipset refresh codenamed 'Falcon' which also includes a 65nm CPU to further reduce heat. An as yet unreleased chip set refresh, codenamed 'Jasper,' will introduce a 65nm GPU and is hoped to solve the 'Red Ring of Death' problem.</p><p>As well as these hardware revisions Microsoft has increased the Xbox 360 warranty to 3 years, however this is only to cover the 'Red Ring of Death' all other hardware problems are only covered for 1 year; this was reported to have cost Microsoft $1 billion.</p><p><i>Note</i>: the new \"XBOX 360 'S'\" does not feature the red LEDs behind the power button. Microsoft removed this particular error message because of the bad connotations associated with this.</p><h3>DVD Drive Problems</h3><p>The DVD Drive is often the target of criticism, mostly for the excessive noise produced and an apparent tendency for scratching discs. These issues are less apparent in later models of the 360 as Microsoft have replaced the initial DVD drive with a quieter model from BenQ.</p><h3>Power Adapter Size</h3><p>The Xbox 360's power adapter is significantly larger than similar adapters on previous consoles. This criticism was mostly vocal at the beginning of the Xbox 360's retail life, as Microsoft has reduced the power adapter's size over the life of the console.</p><h3>Xbox Live Arcade File Size Restriction</h3><p>Xbox Live Arcade games had to come in under the 50 MB file size restriction. While many people felt that that 50MB was too small to create games this limitation allowed 360 owners without the hard drive to enjoy all of the content of XBLA at that time. Over time Microsoft has relaxed restrictions to coincide with the release of larger memory units. Currently the size limit is 2GB and this is a limitation of the backend of service itself rather than an arbitrary limit imposed by Microsoft.</p>","deck":"The Xbox 360 is the second game console produced by Microsoft Corporation and is the successor to the original Xbox.","company":{"api_detail_url":"http://api.giantbomb.com/company/340/","id":340,"name":"Microsoft Studios"},"install_base":67200000,"site_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/60-20/","id":20,"api_detail_url":"http://api.giantbomb.com/platform/20/","abbreviation":"X360","online_support":true,"date_added":"2008-04-01 01:32:50","image":{"icon_url":"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/8271/1865605-xbox_360_icon.png","medium_url":"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/8271/1865605-xbox_360_small.png","tiny_url":"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/8271/1865605-xbox_360_tiny.png","small_url":"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/8271/1865605-xbox_360_small.png","thumb_url":"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/8271/1865605-xbox_360_thumb.png","screen_url":"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/8271/1865605-xbox_360_screen.png","super_url":"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/8271/1865605-xbox_360_super.png"},"release_date":"2005-11-22 00:00:00","name":"Xbox 360"}
