It decided to differentiate the Neo Geo from its competitors by bringing arcade-quality graphics into living rooms. Marketing was heavily geared towards making it a gaming connoisseur's console, and it was even couched as a 24-bit system. It is the longest supported home platform having its first game game released in 1990 and the last game, <a href=\"/samurai-shodown-v-special/61-6538/\">Samurai Shodown V Special</a> released in 2004.</p><h2>Multi Video System</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1675337\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1675337-ikyjo_dscn3310_super.jpg\" title=\"Bare MVS board with typical MVS carts\"><img id=\"1675337\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1675337-ikyjo_dscn3310_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Bare MVS board with typical MVS carts\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Bare MVS board with typical MVS carts</div></div></div></div><p>The MVS (Multi Video System) was a fantastic innovation for the arcade industry. It allowed arcade operators to save on much-needed space by having a single cabinet have multiple games. The MVS came in two, four, and six slot systems; these would allow gamers to pick which game they wanted at the title screen. The control options were the same as the AES four-button system, the only difference being the controls were mounted to cabinet. A key difference between MVS and AES were the cartridges: a MVS cart will not work in an AES, and vice-versa. The goal behind this incompatibility was to deter arcade operators from buying the cheaper AES cartridges. The MVS carts from did not come with colorful artwork or plastic boxes like their home counterparts; they would often come in plain cardboard boxes with only a marquee slip or flyer.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1676408\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-screen\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1676408-japanese_arcade_super.jpg\" title=\"Candy Cabs lined up at a Japanese arcade\"><img id=\"1676408\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1676408-japanese_arcade_screen.jpg\" alt=\"Candy Cabs lined up at a Japanese arcade\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Candy Cabs lined up at a Japanese arcade</div></div></div></div><p>Candy Cabs are Japanese sit down cabinets that SNK used for their MVS machines inside Japanese arcades. These machines are typically smaller and lighter than there American counterparts, some weighing as little as 175 lbs (80 kg). This style of cabinet is normally lined in long uniform rows allowing for each person to have there own screen and controls. Vs play is achieved with either vs cabinets in older machines, or newer networking cabinets.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1693940\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-screen\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1693940-14022801_super.jpg\" title=\"Flyer for the MVS Arcade Cabinet\"><img id=\"1693940\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1693940-14022801_screen.jpg\" alt=\"Flyer for the MVS Arcade Cabinet\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Flyer for the MVS Arcade Cabinet</div></div></div></div><p>In North America Neo Geo games were normally housed in red stand-up cabinets branded with the Neo Geo logo. Becuse by design the MVS had multiple games running on it at one time, the cabinets would rarely have game artwork featured on the side. The North American MVS cabinets supported headphones and a memory card, something that made the MVS unique.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1694390\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1694390-251892859_efabd10364_super.jpg\" title=\"North American MVS layout\"><img id=\"1694390\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1694390-251892859_efabd10364_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"North American MVS layout\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">North American MVS layout</div></div></div></div><p>The North American Neo Geo cabinets have a 4 button layout labeled with the first four letters of the alphabet. The buttons where always colored the same, A being red, B yellow, C green, and D blue. These where the official colors of the Neo Geo buttons, and would appear this way when presented in game. The control panal itself has a red background with white diagonal stripes coming from both corners, meeting in the middle with a Neo Geo logo. The North American cabinets would normally have HAPP brand buttons, and a bat-top joystick.</p><h2>Advanced Entertainment System</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1675120\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-screen\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1675120-neo_geo_games_super.jpg\" title=\"Typical AES packaging with games\"><img id=\"1675120\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1675120-neo_geo_games_screen.jpg\" alt=\"Typical AES packaging with games\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Typical AES packaging with games</div></div></div></div><p>AES (Advanced Entertainment System) is the term used for describing the home platform of the Neo Geo system, as opposed to the arcade or MVS (Multi Video system) version. The term has since become slang to describe AES cartridges themselves, However the proper name for a AES Neo Geo game is NGH. The way to tell an NGH cartridge from its arcade counterpart is the large colorful artwork featured on the home carts. Arcade cartridges had no branding or consumer packaging because they were hidden inside the machines.</p><p>Before the AES was made commercially available it was only sold to larger video rental stores who would in turn rent the system out. This was an unusual practice for a video game platform, and was speculated that this was SNK testing the waters for mass consumption.</p><h2>Neo Geo Memory Card</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1696917\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-screen\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1696917-2046880692_2a897278f8_super.jpg\" title=\"Neo Geo Memory Card\"><img id=\"1696917\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1696917-2046880692_2a897278f8_screen.jpg\" alt=\"Neo Geo Memory Card\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Neo Geo Memory Card</div></div></div></div><p>The Neo Geo system was the first platform to use a removable memory card. The Neo Geo memory card was primarily used to continue from where you left off in an arcade game. The Memory card was also cross-compatible with the AES and would allow you to start a game at home and continue in the arcade, or vice versa.</p><h2>AES Launch Library</h2><p>On January 31 1990 in Osaka Japan the Neo Geo AES was made commercially available.The platform launched with nine titles.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1676512\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1676512-magicianlord__11__super.jpg\" title=\"Magician Lord, one of the Neo Geo launch titles\"><img id=\"1676512\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1676512-magicianlord__11__thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Magician Lord, one of the Neo Geo launch titles\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Magician Lord, one of the Neo Geo launch titles</div></div></div></div><ul><li><a href=\"/cyber-lip/61-4600/\">Cyber-Lip</a></li><li>Mahjong Kyoretsuden</li><li><a href=\"/nam-1975/61-7383/\">NAM-1975</a></li><li>Joy Joy Kid</li><li><a href=\"/riding-hero/61-400/\">Riding Hero</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-super-spy/61-8187/\">The Super Spy</a></li><li>Top Players Golf</li><li><a href=\"/magician-lord/61-2119/\">Magician Lord</a></li><li>Minasan no Okagesama Desu</li></ul><h2>Neo Geo CD</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1686764\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1686764-neogeo_cd_super.jpg\" title=\"The Neo Geo CD Released In 1994\"><img id=\"1686764\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1686764-neogeo_cd_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The Neo Geo CD Released In 1994\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Neo Geo CD Released In 1994</div></div></div></div><p>Released in 1994, the Neo Geo CD was an attempt to compete with CD-based hardware. CDs were also much cheaper to produce than the large NGH cartridges, allowing SNK to sell this platform at a cheaper price point. The Neo Geo CD contained mostly the same hardware, but with a CD drive instead of a cartridge slot.</p><p>The Neo Geo CD had a significant downside when compared to the AES: The load times on some games, particularly fighting games, could be between three to five minutes. With cartridge games being able to load instantly, it made the Neo Geo CD a lesser product.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1686765\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1686765-neogeo_cdz_super.jpg\" title=\"The Neo Geo CDZ\"><img id=\"1686765\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1686765-neogeo_cdz_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The Neo Geo CDZ\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Neo Geo CDZ</div></div></div></div><p>In 1995 the Neo Geo CD underwent a redesign, and was renamed the Neo Geo CDZ. It had much of the same hardware, but with a dual-speed CD drive and a larger memory cache. This reduced load times for CD-based games. There was only a very limited run of Neo Geo CDZ's in Japan; no North American or European versions where made.</p><h2>High Price Point</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1652434\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/4/48363/1652434-biggerbadderbetter_super.gif\" title=\"The 24-bit fallacy\"><img id=\"1652434\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/4/48363/1652434-biggerbadderbetter_thumb.gif\" alt=\"The 24-bit fallacy\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The 24-bit fallacy</div></div></div></div><p>The Neo Geo AES was a notoriously expensive console, costing $650 at launch. There was little effort to emulate or adapt MVS hardware builds for home entertainment use, so cartridges costed as much as existing arcade cabinets ($100-$300). The console failed to gain market share because of these prohibitive costs, although it gained a cult following amongst its targeted demographic of gaming aficionados. The console lost what market share it had earned among enthusiasts by refusing to innovate or improve the system when its competitors did, especially when it did not make the jump to the 32-bit 5th generation of consoles in the late 90s.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"924841\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/8152/924841-90_neo_geo_aes_general2_super.jpg\" title=\"AES Console with 2 controllers and library of games.\"><img id=\"924841\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/8152/924841-90_neo_geo_aes_general2_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"AES Console with 2 controllers and library of games.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">AES Console with 2 controllers and library of games.</div></div></div></div><p>Efforts to make its games more accessible by porting some of the console's exclusives to specialized arcade cabinets enjoyed limited success, but the console could still not compete with its competitors' price cuts and more extensive game libraries. The increased access to the Neo Geo's library did however cement SNK's reputation as a developer of solid fighting games, fueling its success for the rest of the 90's with hits like the <a href=\"/king-of-fighters/62-407/\">King of Fighters</a> franchise.</p><p>The console itself ceased manufacture in 1997, but games for the console would continue to be made and released in arcades, mainly in <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/japan/95-37/\">Japan</a>. The last game for the console was made in 2004, giving it the second-longest lifespan for an arcade-to-home console.</p><h2>Neo Geo Control Options</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1674824\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1674824-neo_geo_super.jpg\" title=\"The Standard Joystick Next to the official Neo Geo CD Joypad\"><img id=\"1674824\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1674824-neo_geo_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The Standard Joystick Next to the official Neo Geo CD Joypad\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Standard Joystick Next to the official Neo Geo CD Joypad</div></div></div></div><p>The Neo Geo AES was a unique system because although an officially-endorsed joypad was available, it was not the standard controller. An arcade stick featuring the same layout as the Neo Geo's MVS counterpart was the pack-in controller used for the system. The controllers used 30 mm arcade buttons and a 35mm ball top joystick.The physical base of the the stick was quite large measuring 280mm x 190mm x 95mm (Width Height Depth), nearly the same size as the system. The joystick has a cult following, with the controller having reproductions made for the <a href=\"/playstation-2/60-19/\">PS2</a>, <a href=\"/playstation-3/60-35/\">PS3</a> and <a href=\"/wii/60-36/\">Wii</a>.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1675912\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-screen\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1675912-neogeo_stick_knob_super.jpg\" title=\"A More Extreme Case of Ball Top Cracking\"><img id=\"1675912\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1675912-neogeo_stick_knob_screen.jpg\" alt=\"A More Extreme Case of Ball Top Cracking\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">A More Extreme Case of Ball Top Cracking</div></div></div></div><p>Although the AES stick has a cult following, it is not without its problems. The buttons on the stick used arcade micro switches but, unlike real arcade buttons, they did not sit inside sleeves. This made it possible for the buttons to rub up against the shell of the stick, this would result in loud squeaking noises or even get stuck underneath the shell. A common aesthetic problem with the AES stick was the joystick ball top getting hairline cracks in the finish, which in extreme cases would cause the ball top to split open. Finally, the button layout on the original Neo Geo was not very ergonomic, a problem which was addressed with the stick's redesign</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1692755\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-screen\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1692755-le_rarissime_neo_geo_mahjong_controller_super.jpg\" title=\"The Official Neo Geo Mahjong Controller Released in 1990\"><img id=\"1692755\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/12/120503/1692755-le_rarissime_neo_geo_mahjong_controller_screen.jpg\" alt=\"The Official Neo Geo Mahjong Controller Released in 1990\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Official Neo Geo Mahjong Controller Released in 1990</div></div></div></div><p>A Mahjong controller was released in 1990 for the Neo Geo AES and is now a rare collectible.

The system's high price point at launch coupled with the fact that games could be hundreds of dollars new meant that most people's libraries of games stayed small. This lead to obscure or popular games becoming more valuable and difficult to track down. For example, the popular AES game <a href=\"/metal-slug-super-vehicle-001/61-6941/\">Metal Slug</a> regularly sells at auctions for eight hundred to two thousand US dollars.
