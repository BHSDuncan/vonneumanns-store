It is most noteable for its terrible translation, so bad in fact that most sentences between characters don't link together to even form a actual conversation.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br /><h2>Translation<br /></h2>&nbsp;As mentioned the game is most noteable for its terrible tanslation and voice work. Many people think that Xs just did the literal translation and didn't localize it to make sense in english. One example of the bad dialogue in this game may been seen <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLE7cM2ZI7w&amp;feature=related\" rel=\"nofollow\">     here</a>. <br />&nbsp;<br /><h2>Gameplay<br /></h2>&nbsp;The gameplay style of Castle Shikigami 2 is your typical top down shoot. You have two types of regular shots and bombs.&nbsp; There are also 5 levels of difficulty to choose from in the game so there will be a challenge for a long time to come. Multiplayer is the same as single player except you are both able to play through the story mode. Dialogue will also be different with each combination of character you choose.   <div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"388482\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/6384/388482-castleshik2ps2_001_large_super.jpg\" title=\" Bullets!!! \"><img id=\"388482\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/6384/388482-castleshik2ps2_001_large_thumb.jpg\" alt=\" Bullets!!! \" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"> Bullets!!! </div></div></div></div> <br />&nbsp;<br /><h3>Normal Attacks<br /></h3>To use the normal you can either rapidly press the square button or hold down the circle button (On the PS2 version). This will use the regular bullet attacks that is specific to your chosen character. <br />&nbsp;<br /><h3>Mobile Light Force 3 Attack<br /></h3>&nbsp;The Mobile Light Force 3 attack is used by holding down the square button. This will use a alternate attack from your regular bullets and they are usually a close range attack. The advantages of useing this attack is that coin dropped from enemies will automatically be collected but your characters speed will decrease. <br />&nbsp;<br /><h3>Special Attack<br /></h3>&nbsp;The special attack is your bomb attack. You will start off with 3 bombs every life and can hold up to a max of 5. During this attack you cannot be damaged, all enemies will be destroyed and bosses will take a large amount of damage. You will be able to regain a bomb at every 250,000,000 points. (You read that right)<br />&nbsp;<br /><h3>Tension Bonus System<br /></h3>&nbsp;The Tension Bonus System works like the graze system in the <a href=\"/touhou-project/62-606/\">    Touhou</a> series of games. When you get really close to an enemy bullet your regular shots will turn red, cover a wider area on screen, and will also do more damage. It is a risk reward type system.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br /><h2>Modes</h2><b>Arcade Mode - </b>This is the normal game mode.
