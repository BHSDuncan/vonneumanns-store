It was largely successful thanks to the ports of old arcade games like <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/pong/61-22195/\">Pong</a>, <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/asteroids/61-1034/\">Asteroids</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/space-invaders/61-5099/\">Space Invaders</a>, and new IPs specifically made for consoles, like <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/pitfall/61-10014/\">Pitfall</a>. The Atari 2600 made the home video game market mainstream, selling 30 million units worldwide before being discontinued in January 1, 1992.</p><h2>System</h2><p>The Atari VCS is an 8-bit video game console that had two outputs. One of them is an RF output, which is mostly used for black and white TVs, and an RCA output, which is mostly used for color TVs.</p><p>The controller is a standard one button and a joystick and serves as the main control scheme for most of the games released on the console. There is also a paddle controller which has a wheel and one button on the side and was mostly used for games like <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/pong/61-22195/\">Pong</a> and <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/breakout/61-13049/\">Breakout</a>. Both of these <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/game-controller/92-3601/\">controllers</a> came with the console. Many other controllers were released later like a driving controller, a <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/keyboard/93-2361/\">keyboard</a>, and a <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/trackball/92-2672/\">trackball</a>. As games began innovating, the Atari 2600 needed the new peripherals to stay fresh. There were also many third-party controllers released for the console and, thanks to the standard controller port (9 pin connector) used for the console, controllers for different consoles, like the <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/genesis/60-6/\">Sega Genesis</a>, can work on the Atari 2600.</p><p>The console came in a sleek, <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/woodgrain/92-4898/\">wooden cover</a>, fitting in with the look of regular TVs of the time. There were a lot of different looks that came along during the years. There was even an Atari 2600 Jr, which was a smaller version of the Atari 2600 that looks like the <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/atari-7800/60-70/\">Atari 7800</a>.</p><h2>Launch titles</h2><h3>United States</h3><p>The Atari 2600 launched along with the following 9 games in October 1977:</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1415321\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/7/73888/1415321-combat_us_front_super.jpg\" title=\"Combat\"><img id=\"1415321\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/7/73888/1415321-combat_us_front_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Combat\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Combat</div></div></div></div><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/air-sea-battle/61-5348/\">Air-Sea Battle</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/basic-math/61-19476/\">Basic Math</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/blackjack/61-23773/\">Blackjack</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/combat/61-5368/\">Combat</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/indy-500/61-19945/\">Indy 500</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/star-ship/61-13503/\">Star Ship</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/video-olympics/61-3294/\">Video Olympics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/surround/61-16028/\">Surround</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/street-racer/61-1811/\">Street Racer</a></li></ul><h2>Video Game Market Crash of 1983</h2><p>In 1983, the video game market was going into a decline. Atari was getting hit the hardest by this crash- after all, this nightmare was caused partially by Atari itself. The main problem with the 2600 at this time was that its game lineup became overcrowded with bad games. This was mostly because Atari had placed no limitations on who could develop games and how many games could be put out in years or even financial quarters, which is now a mainstay in the video game business first implemented by companies like <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/sega/65-62/\">SEGA</a> and <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo/65-90/\">Nintendo</a>. This was around the time that <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/activision/65-78/\">Activision</a> broke off from Atari for more developmental freedom, becoming the first third-party publisher. During 1983, the market was saturated with hundreds of games, with most of them being of poor quality. Since anyone could make games for the Atari 2600, there were all kinds of companies making games who had no place doing so: i.e. cereal and dog food companies, which people would buy and get a refund for later or just ignore. With limited shelf space, retail outlets would eventually stop ordering new software while underselling older products just to make some shelf space. Games were heading into bargain bins, and the games market was going with them.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"316516\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/26/316516-et2600box_super.jpg\" title=\"E.T for the Atari 2600 was a massive financial failure\"><img id=\"316516\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/26/316516-et2600box_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"E.T for the Atari 2600 was a massive financial failure\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">E.T for the Atari 2600 was a massive financial failure</div></div></div></div><p>Two games are often the scapegoats of The Great Games Crash of 1983: the Atari 2600 version of <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/pac-man/61-7624/\">Pac-Man</a> and <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/et-the-extra-terrestrial/61-21595/\">E.T.</a>. Atari decided to get the exclusive rights to port <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/pac-man/61-7624/\">Pac-Man</a> (the most popular arcade game during the time) to the Atari 2600. This idea looked excellent on paper, but in practice was a dismal failure. The final release of <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/pac-man/61-7624/\">Pac-Man</a> for the Atari 2600 VCS barely resembled what the <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/arcade/60-84/\">arcade</a> version was. It was ugly, barely played, and had a sound that would likely haunt your mind to this day if you'd hear it. This version was actually a prototype-a proof of concept with no polish and little developmental time, yet was released anyways. In a rash assumption, Atari printed up more copies than there were Ataris owned, assuming the game would sell systems. The result could not have been more disastrous. Very few copies were sold and Atari was stuck in an awkward financial situation. <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/et-the-extra-terrestrial/61-21595/\">E.T.</a> was its own disaster. The same sort of hubris occurred and Atari, so sure of itself, pressed too many copies once more. However, the game was of such poor quality that almost all sold copies of <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/et-the-extra-terrestrial/61-21595/\">E.T.</a> were returned and refunded. This was such a disaster that it was more cost effective for Atari to simply bury all the copies in a landfill in New Mexico (which is the popular rumor). Atari never truly recovered from this shock.</p>","deck":"The Atari 2600 is one of the first home game consoles, and one of the most successful at the time.
