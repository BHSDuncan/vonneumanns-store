Branching off from the traditional game pad controller from Nintendo's previous consoles, the Wii features a wireless controller, referred to as the Wii Remote, which is used as a handheld pointing device and detects movement in three dimensions. Although the console was unveiled earlier in the year at the <i>Electronic Entertainment Expo</i>, the Wii Remote was not shown until the <i>Tokyo Game Show</i> in September of that year..</p><p>The Wii launched in <a href=\"../../north-america/95-1664/\" rel=\"nofollow\">North America</a> on November 19, 2006, December 2, 2006 in <a href=\"../../japan/95-37/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Japan</a> and on December 8, 2006 in Europe. Since its launch, the console has sold over 50 million consoles as of March 2009. The Wii has been infamous for its limited availability, and people have complained about how few consoles can be found in stores. According to Nintendo, they are making nearly one million Wii consoles per month, however. The Wii continues Nintendo's tradition of choosing lower specifications of hardware components to be able to gain a profit off the hardware alone. Where their competitors are willing to lose money upfront off the hardware sales and make up for the loss with software and subscription based revenues.</p><p>Originally, the console was known as the 'Nintendo Revolution', a code name to explain Nintendo's plans with the console. When it was unveiled, it was dark black, but upon its release it had changed to a white and blue color scheme. The name <i>Wii</i> has had many official explanations.</p><p>Nintendo stated that the plural form of Wii is, contrary to popular belief, not \"Wiis.\" Instead, it is \"Wii consoles\" or \"Wii systems.\" The two i's in Wii are meant to represent two players standing next to each other, or the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. One explanation for the name is as follows:</p><blockquote><p><i>\"Wii sounds like 'we,' which emphasizes that the console is for everyone. Wii can easily be remembered by people around the world, no matter what language they speak. No confusion. No need to abbreviate. Just Wii.\"</i></p></blockquote><p>The Wii has been criticized for disrupting the way game publishers have been doing business for years. The ease for game publishers to release games on the platform caused a lot of competition in the Wii market, where normally very popular types of games in other systems would fail to become popular on the Wii. However, the Wii became one of the best selling video game systems ever made, breaking records worldwide, including the best selling video game system in Europe, as well as many of it's games going on to become the best selling videogames of all time.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2204650\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/10/105915/2204650-wiislim.png\" title='The \"Family Edition\" Wii Model'><img id=\"2204650\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/10/105915/2204650-wiislim_thumb.png\" alt='The \"Family Edition\" Wii Model' /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The \"Family Edition\" Wii Model</div></div></div></div><p>In December 2011 Nintendo discontinued the launch model of the Wii and released a \"Slim\" version of the Wii in Europe. No specific reason is given by Nintendo for this re-release. The \"Slim\" Wii has the same specifications as the launch model with the exception for <a href=\"/gamecube/60-23/\">GameCube</a> support, resulting in no support for GameCube games and the lack of GameCube controller ports and GameCube memory card slots. The console launched in the colors black and white and is bundled with a <a href=\"/wii-motionplus/59-25/\">Wii MotionPlus</a>, <a href=\"/wii-sports/61-13328/\">Wii Sports</a> and <a href=\"/wii-party/61-31210/\">Wii Party</a>. Because of its horizontal orientation and smaller form factor, it is said to fit under TV sets more easily.</p><h2>Launch Titles</h2><h3>U.S.</h3><ul><li><a

Clicking on the icon brings you to the SD card menu, where up to 20 screens are fillable. Games can be downloaded to and launched directly from an SD or SDHC card without going through the Wii System Memory menus.

When a disc is loaded in (either Wii or GameCube), the two discs spin around, eventually stop, and then one falls down as if it is being loaded in a slot. Then, the game's splash screen appears, and the player has the option to either play the game or return to the Wii Menu screen.</li><li><b>Mii Channel</b> - Another default channel, the Mii Channel is used to design custom avatars known as Miis. Players can customize many aspects of their virtual avatar. The Mii interactivity is one of the frequently advertised parts of the Wii.</li><li><b>Photo Channel</b> - Players can upload pictures and videos through use of an SD card or from received messages on the Wii message board, and then use various effects to alter the image. Sound files .MP3, .AAC, and .M4A are also compatible with the channel, so the user can play a slideshow accompanied by music. The Photo Channel's icon in the Wii Menu can be customized with a picture.</li><li><b>Wii Shop Channel</b> - The <a href=\"../../wii-shop/60-87/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wii Shop Channel</a> is a channel that allows users to purchase games. It is divided into three categories: <a href=\"../../virtual-console/92-2925/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Virtual Console</a>, <a href=\"../../wiiware/92-2695/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WiiWare</a>, and Wii Channels. Games can be purchased on the Virtual Console that have been released in previous generations, from a variety of consoles. WiiWare consists of small-budget games that have been released by amateur developers wanting to get a name, or sometimes larger companies releasing games not big enough for a retail release. Wii Points must be purchased to buy any games on this channel, which can be bought in increments of 1000 ($10.00 USD) on the channel itself, or in various retail stores (Nintendo Points).</li><li><b>Forecast Channel</b> - Users navigate a large 3D world to find weather forecasts for their area. By merely clicking on the channel, however, users can see a quick forecast if WiiConnect24 is on. Some games use the information from the Forecast Channel to change the in-game weather (such as <a href=\"../../madden-nfl-07/61-16585/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Madden NFL 07</a> and <a href=\"../../nights-journey-of-dreams/61-4161/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NiGHTS: Journey of Dreams</a>).</li><li><b>News Channel</b> - The News Channel allows users to view headlines from various current events. The news articles are from the Associated Press, and are available in a variety of languages. The news headlines are available in many different categories, and they are automatically updated as news comes in.</li><li><b>Internet Channel</b> - The Internet Channel is a browser for the Wii based on the Opera browser. Originally, it was free, but it is now available for a one time payment of 500 Wii Points ($5.00 USD), although users who downloaded it for free do not have to pay. The browser has USB keyboard compatibility and supports many of the same standards as the Opera browser available for computers.</li><li><b>Everybody Votes Channel</b> - The Everybody Votes Channel is a channel where users vote in a variety of opinion polls. All questions are created by Nintendo, based off of submitted user questions. You can track your stats, such as your \"distance from popular opinion\", and good you are at predicting the popular answer. A map showing how ones specific country votes is also available to users.</li><li><b>Check Mii Out Channel</b> - The Check Mii Out Channel allows users to upload and download others' Miis and share them to users around the world.

It's realistic portrayal caused many gamers, as well as industry insiders, to think it was the real deal.</li><li>Wii was originally going to launch with an ethernet port in the back, but later switched to Wi-Fi to minimize space.</li><li>The idea for \"Mii\" dates back to Nintendo's <a href=\"../../famicom-disk-system/60-91/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Famicon Disk System</a>, where users could create avatars for themselves in games.</li><li>WiiWare was actually ready for launch since the console's release in America, but was held back for lack of support.</li></ul>","deck":"The Wii is a home video game console released by Nintendo on November 19, 2006.
