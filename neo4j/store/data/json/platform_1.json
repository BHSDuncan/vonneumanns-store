Commodore acquired Amiga Corporation in the summer of 1984, snatching the Amiga chipset from under the nose of <a href=\"/atari/65-182/\">          Atari,</a> who originally funded the project. Commodore filed for bankruptcy in 1994, despite the success of the A1200 and CD32.<br /><br /><h2>Hardware</h2>The Amiga range was based on the Motorola 68000 chipset, but made use of proprietary graphics and sound co-processors (codenamed Denise and Paula respectively), which took the load off of the CPU and allowed the Amiga to process more than just gaming graphics extremely efficiently. The Amiga revoulitioned video production, providing an afordable CG solution with the Video Toaster. And it was the first&nbsp;non profesional grade&nbsp;computer to be able to sample and record stereo in 44.1khz at it's release date. Over the lifetime of the computer, three chipsets were used: OCS (Original ChipSet), ECS (Enhanced ChipSet) and AGA (Advanced Graphics Architecture).<br /><br /><h3>Models</h3>The most popular Amiga models were as follows:<br /><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>A1000 (1985) $1,295</li></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  OCS, 256k Chip RAM, 256k \"Slow\" RAM, AmigaOS 1.0<br /><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>A2000 (1986)<br /></li></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  OCS, 512k Chip RAM, 512k \"Slow\" RAM, AmigaOS 1.2<br /><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>A500 (1987) $595.95</li></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OCS, 512k Chip RAM, 512k \"Slow\" RAM, AmigaOS 1.3<br /><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>A1500 (1990) Â£999<br /></li></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  OCS, 512k Chip RAM, 512k \"Slow\" RAM, AmigaOS 1.3<i><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The A1500 was virtually identical to the A2000 apart from a 2nd Floppy drive that replaced the Hard Dis</i>k.&nbsp; Released in UK only<br /><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>A3000(1990) <br /></li></ul> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; ECS , 1MB Chip RAM, 1MB \"Fast\" RAM, AmigaOS 1.3<br /><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>A500  (1991)</li></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  ECS, 512k Chip RAM, 512k \"Slow\" RAM, AmigaOS 2.0<br /><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>A600 (1992)</li></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  ECS, 1MB Chip RAM (upgradeable to 2MB), \"Fast\" RAM upgradeable to 6MB.
