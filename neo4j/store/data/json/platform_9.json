The machine debuted in Japan on November 21, 1990, and arrived in North America, South America, Europe, and Australia during September of 1991.</p><p>The SNES was a 16-bit console and a direct competitor to <a href=\"/sega/65-62/\">Sega</a>'s Genesis. As with the NES, the SNES was the most successful console of its generation in terms of sales. The console triumphed through the support of both Nintendo and third-party developers. The console saw releases from high profile developers such as <a href=\"/capcom/65-367/\">Capcom</a>, <a href=\"/squaresoft/65-6323/\">Squaresoft</a>, and <a href=\"/konami-corporation/65-87/\">Konami</a>. The SNES era is looked back on by many as \"the golden era of video games.\"</p><p>Nintendo introduced an arcade system called the <a href=\"/nintendo-super-system/92-3204/\">Nintendo Super System</a> in the early nineties that could be used to preview upcoming Super Nintendo games. Games that appeared on it included <a href=\"/super-mario-world/61-1334/\">Super Mario World</a>, <a href=\"/actraiser/61-7274/\">ActRaiser</a>, <a href=\"/contra-iii-the-alien-wars/61-3016/\">Contra III: The Alien Wars</a>, and <a href=\"/f-zero/61-15242/\">F-Zero</a>.</p><h3>Rivalry with Sega</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"873617\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/7464/873617-large_super.jpg\" title=\"Genesis does what Nintendon't.\"><img id=\"873617\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/7464/873617-large_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Genesis does what Nintendon't.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Genesis does what Nintendon't.</div></div></div></div><p>Nintendo and <a href=\"/sega/65-62/\">Sega</a> maintained a fierce rivalry during the 16-bit era. Sega's Genesis was released before the SNES, and this head start allowed the Genesis to gain a substantial sales lead by the time the SNES came to market. Simultaneously, Sega ran an aggressive marketing campaign that portrayed the SNES and its players as slow and childlike when compared to the speedy and \"cool\" Genesis. One of the most notorious of these ads touted the Genesis' (non-existant) \"<a href=\"/blast-processing/92-963/\">Blast Processing</a>,\" which ostensibly allowed the Genesis to better render high-speed games such as <a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/61-2465/\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> . While the Genesis led the SNES in sales throughout most of the 16-bit generation, the SNES eventually overtook it as the generation ended.</p><h2>History</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"813478\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/7464/813478-snes_logo_super.png\" title=\"The Super Famicom logo in Japan and PAL regions\"><img id=\"813478\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/7464/813478-snes_logo_thumb.png\" alt=\"The Super Famicom logo in Japan and PAL regions\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Super Famicom logo in Japan and PAL regions</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/nec-technologies-inc/65-1741/\">NEC</a> released the <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/turbografx-16/60-55/\">TurboGrafx-16</a> in 1987 to compete with the incredibly popular NES. <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/sega/65-62/\">Sega</a> released its <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/genesis/60-6/\">Genesis</a> the next year. Both of these consoles were based on 16-bit hardware, and were large improvements in sound and graphics over the 8-bit based NES. As Nintendo's dominance in the market began slipping, Nintendo executives began to design a new system (albeit reluctantly at first) as early as 1988.</p><p>The SNES was designed by <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/masayuki-uemura/72-69066/\">Masayuki Uemura</a>, who also designed the original Famicom. The Super Famicom was originally released in Japan on November 21, 1990 for Â¥25,000, or about $210. It was a huge hit, with the initial units shipped selling very quickly. With the Super Famicom being such a success, Nintendo dominated over their rivals. This was partially due to the support of third-party developers, such as <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/capcom/65-367/\">Capcom</a>, <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/konami-corporation/65-87/\">Konami</a>, <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/square-co-ltd/65-6323/\">Square</a>, <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/enix-corporation/65-6337/\">Enix</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/tecmo-inc/65-485/\">Tecmo</a>.</p><p>The Super Nintendo Entertainment System was released in North America in September 1991. It was a mildly redesigned version of the Super Famicom that originally sold for $199. One of the main selling points for the console was the fact that it was packaged with Super Mario World. Originally, very few titles were shipped upon release, such as <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/pilotwings/61-14727/\">Pilotwings</a>, <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/f-zero/61-15242/\">F-Zero</a>, <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/simcity/61-15035/\">SimCity</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/gradius-iii/61-7617/\">Gradius III</a>, but these titles were all very well-received and showcased the SNES's Mode 7 abilities.</p><h3>Policies</h3><p>Nintendo's policies during the NES era were infamous: Nintendo had to approve every game, third-party developers could release only five games per year (and these games couldn't be released on a rival console within two years), and Nintendo controlled the manufacturing and supply of NES cartridges. When Sega began competing with Nintendo, however, these practices ended. Acclaim was the first developer to release their games for both consoles, and many other developers followed suit.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"873638\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/7464/873638-1112203563_04_super.png\" title=\"The censored SNES version.\"><img id=\"873638\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/7464/873638-1112203563_04_thumb.png\" alt=\"The censored SNES version.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The censored SNES version.</div></div></div></div><p>Nintendo, however, maintained their strict censorship policy. This was one of the key reasons why the Genesis version of <a href=\"/mortal-kombat/61-15743/\">Mortal Kombat</a> sold much better than the SNES version. Nintendo removed all of the gore from the game, including fatalities, while the Genesis version kept these things.</p><p>Mortal Kombat's gore also sparked US Senators Herb Kohl and Joe Lieberman to call a Congressional hearing to discuss the effect of violent games on children. This meeting caused the founding of the Interactive Digital Software Association (now known as the Entertainment Software Association) and the <a href=\"/entertainment-software-ratings-board/65-6476/\">Entertainment Software Rating Board</a> (which applies ratings to all games). Because of these companies being founded, Nintendo decided their censorship policies were no longer needed, and <a href=\"/mortal-kombat-ii/61-3571/\">Mortal Kombat 2</a> was released in an uncensored version on the SNES, which caused it to sell better than the Genesis version.</p><h2>Technical Specifications</h2><ul><li><b>CPU</b>: Custom 65c816 based Ricoh 5A22 running at a selectable 3.58 MHz, 2.66 Mhz or 1.77 Mhz.</li><li><b>Memory</b>: 128 Kb main RAM, 64 Kb video RAM, 64 Kb audio RAM</li><li><b>Video</b>: 256 x 224 or 512 x 224 or 256 x 239 or 512 x 239 progressive resolutions, 512 x 448 or 512 x 478 interlaced resolutions, 32,768 colors (256 colors max on screen)</li><li><b>Audio</b>: 2 Sony audio processors (1 8-bit, and 1 16-bit DSP) 8 channels, Sample Rate 32KHz, 16-bit stereo output</li><li>The SNES can also take advantage of custom chips provided by the individual game cartridges, like the \"Super FX\" co-processor chip that ran at either 10.5Mhz or 21Mhz depending on the game.

While purple and blue were used on the North American SNES, the Super Famicom as well as the European and Australian SNES had a logo consisting of rounded green, blue, yellow, and red shapes matching the Super Famicom's and PAL SNES' colored A, B, X, and Y buttons. Additionally, each version of the console has its own version of region lockout, with differently shaped cartridges, rendering a Japanese or PAL version of a game useless on a North American console and vice versa.</p><h3>Hardware Revision</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"232259\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/245/232259-img_0078_super.jpg\" title=\"The SNS-101\"><img id=\"232259\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/245/232259-img_0078_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The SNS-101\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The SNS-101</div></div></div></div><p>On October 20, 1997 the Super Nintendo received lighter and more streamlined design in the US.

It was targeted at gamers who where not ready to buy expensive next generation hardware and wanted something with a large library of cheaper games.</p><p>Pack in games included:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past/61-10276/\">The Legend of Zelda: a Link to the Past</a></li><li><a href=\"/super-mario-world-2-yoshis-island/61-2866/\">Super Mario World 2 : Yoshi's Island</a></li><li><a href=\"/super-mario-all-stars-super-mario-world/61-544/\">Super Mario All Stars &amp; Super Mario World</a></li></ul><h3><a href=\"/mode-7/92-184/\">Mode 7</a></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"254065\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/4231/254065-f_zero_snes_screenshot_white_land_super.jpg\" title=\"F-Zero extensively uses Mode 7.\"><img id=\"254065\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/4231/254065-f_zero_snes_screenshot_white_land_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"F-Zero extensively uses Mode 7.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">F-Zero extensively uses Mode 7.</div></div></div></div><p>Mode 7 is one of the SNES's seven different graphics modes, and the most famous of the seven. It was famous for allowing SNES games to display pseudo-3D graphics, giving the illusion of depth. The mode was able to warp the background layer of a game, changing the perspective to make the background appear to be moving. This was used prominently in a variety of games, to various effects. <a href=\"/final-fantasy-iv/61-20829/\">Final Fantasy IV</a> and <a href=\"/final-fantasy-vi/61-6336/\">Final Fantasy VI</a> used it to give the overworld an illusion of movement and size; when the player goes into an airship, the ground below shrinks away as the player gets higher and higher.</p><p>One limitation of Mode 7 was that it only allowed the background layer to be scaled and rotated. Individual sprites could not have this effect applied to them. So games like <a href=\"/super-castlevania-iv/61-11443/\">Super Castlevania IV</a> and <a href=\"/super-metroid/61-8292/\">Super Metroid</a>, where characters appear to have that effect applied to them are actually part of the background layer. In <a href=\"/contra-iii-the-alien-wars/61-3016/\">Contra III: The Alien Wars</a>, where massive bosses appear to rotate and twist, they actually are the \"background,\" and the background is actually a sprite that changes with the player's movement.</p><h3>Enhancement Chips</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"477089\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/8571/477089-star_fox__v1.2___u_____002_super.png\" title=\"Star Fox's 3D graphics are powered by the Super FX chip.\"><img id=\"477089\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/8571/477089-star_fox__v1.2___u_____002_thumb.png\" alt=\"Star Fox's 3D graphics are powered by the Super FX chip.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Star Fox's 3D graphics are powered by the Super FX chip.</div></div></div></div><p>There were a variety of first and third party enhancement chips included in SNES games. The most famous of these chips is the Super FX chip, used in games such as <a href=\"/star-fox/61-3984/\">Star Fox</a> and <a href=\"/stunt-race-fx/61-19991/\">Stunt Race FX</a>. However, there are numerous other notable chips, including the GB-Z80, DSP, CX4, S-RTC. The Super FX chip actually works to accelerate the graphics, making the SNES capable of more detailed, and even 3D, graphics. Its effects are seen in many games, including <a href=\"/doom/61-7326/\">Doom</a> and <a href=\"/super-mario-world-2-yoshis-island/61-2866/\">Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island</a>.</p><p>The GB-Z80 chip was used in the <a href=\"/super-game-boy-enhancement/92-4804/\">Super Game Boy</a>, and it enabled the SNES to emulate <a href=\"/game-boy/60-3/\">Game Boy</a> hardware effectively. The SNES's processor was not powerful enough on its own. The DSP chip, of which there are several varieties, increases the capabilities of the SNES's Mode 7. The CX4 was a math processor used by <a href=\"/capcom/65-367/\">Capcom</a> in <a href=\"/mega-man-x2/61-19801/\">Mega Man X2</a> and <a href=\"/mega-man-x3/61-16948/\">Mega Man X3</a>, aiding in the formation of trigonometric graphics. The S-RTC was used in one game (Dai Kaiju Monogatari 2) to power a real-time in-game clock.</p><h2>Launch Titles</h2><h3>Japanese Launch Titles (November 21, 1990)</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/super-mario-world/61-1334/\">Super Mario World</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/f-zero/61-15242/\">F-Zero</a></li></ul><h3>U.S. Launch Titles (August 23, 1991)</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/super-mario-world/61-1334/\">Super Mario World</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/f-zero/61-15242/\">F-Zero</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/pilotwings/61-14727/\">Pilotwings</a></li></ul><h3>European Launch Titles (April 11, 1992)</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/super-soccer/61-11864/\">Super Soccer</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/super-tennis/61-18664/\">Super Tennis</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/super-r-type/61-8479/\">Super R-Type</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/f-zero/61-15242/\">F-Zero</a></li></ul><h2>Peripherals and Alternate Control Options</h2><p>Nintendo's first trial into CD-ROM games was with the SNES in Japan, releasing games such as <a href=\"/secret-of-mana/61-19507/\">Secret of Mana</a> and several <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/62-9/\">Legend of Zelda</a> games.
